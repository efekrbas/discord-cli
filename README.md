## Installation

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. You're ready to go! `clicord` will automatically grab your tokens from your active Discord desktop applications (Stable, Canary, PTB) and prompt you to select an account.

### Manual Token Entry (Optional)

If you don't have the Discord desktop app installed or want to use a specific account, you can manually setup a `.env` file:
- **Windows**: Run `setup_env.bat` to automatically create the `.env` file. Open the created file and paste your token after the `=` sign.
- **Manual**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your token:
```
DISCORD_USER_TOKEN=your_user_token_here
```

#### How to Get Your Discord User Token Manually
- Watch this [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/rcwWex7aqTo) if you don't know how to obtain your user token.

**⚠️ Important Security Notes:**
- **Never share your user token with anyone!**
- Your token grants full access to your entire Discord account.
- If you suspect your token is compromised, change your Discord password immediately to reset it.
- *Disclaimer: Using self-bots may be prohibited under Discord's Terms of Service. Use this application at your own risk.*
